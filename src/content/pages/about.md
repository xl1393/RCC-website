Led by Ashiwel Undieh, PhD, Core Director, and Associate Directors, Jie Wei, PhD; Mark Hauber, PhD; Mitchell Schaffler, PhD; and Nancy Sohler, PhD, this Core is designed to enhance researchers' capabilities to conduct high-quality biomedical, behavioral, and clinical research to reduce health disparities in underserved communities in New York City, which reflects NYC's economic disparity. This initiative supports clinical studies, recruits talented research-design counselors and data-savvy staff, trains researchers in advanced techniques, and adapts AI technologies for clinical, behavioral, and community research.
