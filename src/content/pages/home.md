title: Welcome to the Research Capacity Core (RCC) of the New York Center for
  Advancing Translational Research and Health (NYCATRH) at CUNY.
subtitle: >-
  The NYCATRH is a National Institutes of Health U54-sponsored Center that is
  currently housed at the CUNY School of Medicine. As one of twenty-two Research
  Centers at Minority Institutions (RCMI) programs, the mission of NYCATRH is to
  promote research that could translate to improvements in the health outcomes
  of ALL New Yorkers and nationally. 


  The RCC is the arm of the Center that drives the strengthening of research productivity and translation to improve health. The RCC supports faculty researchers by facilitating access to advanced resources in research technology, analytics, artificial intelligence, and bioinformatics. The RCC offers technical training, expert consultations, and collaborative opportunities to boost research rigor and innovation. Bioinformatics & artificial intelligence (AI) are a core focus, providing expertise in experimental design and data analysis to handle complex health data and support impactful, community-engaged research at CCNY. 


  The RCC provides support for researchers from any CUNY program at various stages of research development from postdoctorate to tenured professorship levels. To be supported, however, the research must bear current or prospective relevance to the mission of the Center. Please explore other links on this RCC site for further information.



  Support is provided in five main areas:

  • Research equipment and core facilities access

  • Project and research planning

  • Data analysis and warehousing

  • Computational programming

  • Conferencing and publication support
