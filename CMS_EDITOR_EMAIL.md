3. Click **"Authorize"** when asked (first time only)

4. You'll see the CMS dashboard with three sections:
   - **Pages** - Edit Home Page and About Us
   - **Skills Pages** - Edit all 7 skills pages
   - **Blog Posts** - Create, edit, or delete blog posts

5. To edit:

   - Make your changes
   - Click **"Save"** → then **"Publish"**
   - Wait 2-3 minutes for changes to appear on the live site

## Important Notes

✅ Your changes are NOT instant - allow 2-3 minutes for the site to rebuild

✅ All changes are tracked and can be undone if needed

✅ If using the shared account, please log out when done

❌ Don't edit the Resources page - it's not available in the CMS (contact me if you need changes there)
